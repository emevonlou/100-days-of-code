# 100 Days Of Code - 2019 - Log

### Day 1: March 15

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 items and started the Introduction to Basic CSS, concluding the first five items.

**Thoughts:** I had an initial difficulty with nesting and in the first few lines I insisted on putting semicolon at the end of everything. The methodology and respectful rhythm of the freecodecamp helped me a lot to stay focused so that I was naturally adapting myself. The terms used although grammatically similar to everyday, seem to dance with the tags, this made everything as interesting as dangerous and delayed me a little ... That is, a paradox: The best thing in a challenge!

## Day 2: March 16

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** I was a few minutes late because I hesitated in understanding the Fallback value to a CSS Variable. When I knew what to do, I did not know exactly where to put it. I confess that it made me laugh at myself sometimes. The second day was much warmer! CSS is addictive.

## Day 3: March 17

**Today's Progress**: Started Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts:** My purpose was to finish "Applied Visual Design". But today, I had to be more present in my son's life. I'm leaving nine extra items for tomorrow, with great joy for that.

## Day 4: March 18

**Today's Progress**: Applied Visual Design and Applied Accessibility completed!

**Thoughts:** I'm on the fourth day and I'm still surprised. The dialectical relationship between my person and knowledge is being given to me, could not be better. For each step, a "welcome" and a "goodbye" to the doubts that before the learning process, it seemed to me an endless condition. I was surprised by the Bezier curve, in how it makes the movement more harmonious.I had fun grouping elements with fieldset and improving accessibility with Landmark.I was happy , because there is nothing better than appreciate the main content with your element . =) I felt safe when I learned that I can improve content using the article element. I was feel great recognizing and identifying the figcaption element nested to the figure element to construct the independence of specific content, related to the main content. I found difficulties, but I did not lose focus. Let's move on! I look forward to the next topic.

## Day 5: March 19

**Today's Progress**: Responsive Web Design Principles completed.

**Thoughts:** I had difficulty with Responsive Web Design Principles. It took me to finish the last two items. What helped me to make it simple were the previous concepts, in particular, of the basic properties of css. How basic is important!

## Day 6: March 20

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** I believe that with Flexbox you can create and organize layouts with CSS3 in a very elegant way. Through its properties / possibilities, I realized that tasks can be achieved with very few lines of code.

## Day 7: March 21

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grid completed.

**Thoughts:** We can more easily determine the reading stream.
The grid helps us design the harmonious ones by balancing the weights of the graphic elements of the layout.
Help position the elements more accurately.

## Day 8: March 22

**Today's Progress**: "Build a Tribute Page" completed.

**Thoughts:** Today was deliberately challenging. I considered the rules, though I felt like breaking a few. I may have broken it from trying so hard to follow them. One of the things that most appeals to me in the world code is precisely this incredible possibility of freedom. Anyway, very happy. I've encountered difficulties, of course. I'm a good beginner.

## Day 9: March 23

**Today's Progress**: "Tribute Page" github repository.

**Thoughts:** Today I decided to reinforce the knowledge by creating a github repository with the content of the previous challenge.
It is using [express to serve the static files](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/starter/static-files.html).

## Day 10: March 24

**Today's Progress**: Building a Survey Form.(work in progress)

**Thoughts:** After a race at a pace incomprehensible to me of assimilation of isolated knowledge, I saw myself in another level: to organize everything.Being cautious has helped me focus on the details, I'm taking it easy, and a hurry just to make everything simpler. But today, better than yesterday, I felt progress in relation to to the pace I need.

## Day 11: March 25

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form completed.

**Thoughts:** My experience today was sensational, especially when my submit button disappeared. I thought: OMG. The web development's discipline is causing me a tremendous good mood. After a few frustrating attempts, a "noob" feeling became more and more present, then I decided to impose myself with a peculiar simplicity.

## Day 12: March 26

**Today's Progress**: "Survey Form" github repository/ Starting build of Product Landing Page.

**Thoughts:** I like the initiations of projects, they always raise the possibility of the permanence of something beautiful. Of course, for this to happen, we need to devote time. I followed steps similar to the previous one: I used node.js and express as static file server, prepared the html structure and I am observing it as the one that decides, in all beginner joy, how the structures will "dance".

## Day 13: March 27

**Today's Progress**: Build of Product Landing Page.(work in progress)

**Thoughts:** Today was full of different obligations, but amazingly for me, I made some progress in css.

## Day 14: March 28

**Today's Progress**: Build of Product Landing Page.(work in progress)

**Thoughts:** Acquiring knowledge is something valuable. But holding on to organizing them is sublime, requiring depth. It's like a second affirmation of your goal. I confess, this part has been the hardest part of me. In programming itself, in what I felt in deep freedom, I committed to the value of the code, in the discipline, so that my code never looked like what it should be, although it works. This is so funny, because I felt so good programming messy loops. It's like feeling you know how to drive well and be disapproved in the traffic test for not knowing the proper procedure in practice. I feel that the initiative of the 100 days of the code is taking me where I always wanted to be, but I did not know where to start. Today was to put my "landing page" that was not at all responsive and not pretty, in github- with the promise of daily implementation until it is good for me, and organizational study day on Grid and Flexbox. Going back is not an option. That's when I can say gently: Forward.

## Day 15: March 29

**Today's Progress**: Landing Page Completed


**Thoughts:** The curious case for me in today's progress has been to keep each other within the boundaries with the code. You wait for the answer to continue, as in a dance, so maybe my menu has not been responsive (laughs). But I realized with the feat, so simple, so true. Tomorrow I try again and again .... Today was the day to investigate, to order and to transform. Happy.

## Day 16: March 30

**Today's Progress**: Training grid and Flexbox.


**Thoughts:** Today was a day of break between projects, I decided to extend the "Saturday night fever" taking advantage of all the charm that Grid and Flexbox promote me. Why do I like it so much? Because it is necessary to be lived like this. And these things are invaluable. I researched, messed, solved and customized examples. I mixed it as someone does at a party, enchanted by the scent of flowers. It's working!

## Day 17: March 31

**Today's Progress**: Start Build a Technical Documentation Page.


**Thoughts:** I started the technical documentation page today, preparing the structure of HTML and CSS, and gradually, responsiveness is no longer a problem. One of the things that has most impressed me in this learning is that it always puts me in a position of humility, but that, in disinterested fidelity, makes me look up.


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://codepen.io/emevonlou/pen/XQWEPj)


## Day 18: April 1

**Today's Progress**: Start Build a Technical Documentation Page.(work in progress)


**Thoughts:** Even with the day full of things to do, even believing that in many moments I could not get the time, I managed to realize a little of what stayed in my memories all day. Happy.


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://codepen.io/emevonlou/pen/XQWEPj)


## Day 19: April 2

**Today's Progress**: Technical Documentation Page Completed.


**Thoughts:** I tried to produce something simple with a subtle touch of ~80's shell visuals, I wanted to make "hover {}" in the "links" and "headers" and a light simulation of "Monochrome Display type CRT". I wanted documentation that provoked me (with css and html) a certain curiosity without losing its simplicity. Historical knowledge is a revive, and performing that work with html, css and reading more about the shell certainly was a sure assertion of this.


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://codepen.io/emevonlou/pen/XQWEPj)


## Day 20: April 3

**Today's Progress**: Start Personal Portfolio Webpage.


**Thoughts:** I prepared the html skeleton, this time with a bit more attention than before. I wrote the css and putting @media (which I consider particularly wonderful). I've been exploring the repetitions, and I've been able to develop a form that always enables responsiveness(finally). I've had some difficulties, for example, my portfolio h2 "refusing" to be centralized, but I can confess that I'm anxious so I can accomplish the deeds of my simplest ideas. I believe that with time, dedication, and respect for each experience, I'll understand each thing, in its truest sense. I hope I can finish tomorrow!


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)


## Day 21: April 4

**Today's Progress**: Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.(completed)


**Thoughts:** Today was the day I finished my portfolio. The problem of the "h2" tag was solved, I, for a mishap of existence, had typed the wrong session id. I continued with the development, today had more spacing between the elements of the nav than I did on my landing page - I really wanted something different from the ones I had done and also the one indicated. Tomorrow I start the Javascript course (YAY), and so begins my process again.I am immensely grateful to the community, all of you, for your support, encouragement, understanding. Without you, this process would not have been lived with such tenderness. Gratitude for the various lessons. It was necessary to be lived, and you, along with me, believed. Thanks!

## Day 22: April 5

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Javascript


**Thoughts:** Today was the day to start the JavaScript language, one of the main characters from 1995 to the present. I gave myself the pleasure, from the comments, to the Quoting Strings with Single Quotes. Searching on each topic using in a "peering" style, exploring theoretical concepts of the js language. Just as I have discovered css (addictive) and html (stimulant), I want to complete the basic javascript with the same category it represents for me. happy!

## Day 23: April 6

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Javascript- I stopped in Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function.


**Thoughts:** I continued the study in the code sentences, I had fun with push, pop, shift, unshift in arrays. Trying to think as simply as possible, this has helped me a lot in learning. Finding out how Javascript is organized is a wonderful task. Understanding the indefinite value returned from a function reminded me of the unpredictability we have developed, simply because we do not include return statements, and even though there is a correct internal process, the returned value will always be undefined. My happiness to know, that even this, javaScript teaches.

## Day 24: April 7

**Today's Progress**: Basic Javascript-Completed


**Thoughts:** I can never forget that Sunday day. The challenge of a new language is never an easy task. I began by deconstructing within myself this idea of difficulty. It was not easy either. But I felt more stubborn than scared. This recognition was very important, because it was what in the moments threatening, made me stop and think. Everything became clearer later. Javascript reminded me of C ++ on several occasions and the smile was always inevitable, that was also encouraging. I accepted this challenge as a tacit contract. Tomorrow I'll start ES6! I do not know where to put so much happiness.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/emevonlou)


## Day 25: April 8

**Today's Progress**: Start ES6


**Thoughts:** After an exciting weekend with Javascript, I had to start very calmly on ES6. `var` gave way to `let` and `const` is the favorite. With `Object.freeze` I learned to value specific objects, to replace them and to display them when necessary. I was not accustomed to writing constants in "capslock", this gave me some instant bugs accompanied by shy smiles later. On the `Arrow Functions`- (OMG), there is a simplicity full of meaning, less lines of code, that say more than enough to impressed.

## Day 26: April 9

**Today's Progress**: Start ES6(work in progress)


**Thoughts:** I am exercising and learning to perceive when a concept asks to be abstracted into a new word. And something has taken my thinking for a few hours: Arrays for example, when an array is provided for the method to act on it, forEach expects only one required argument: the function to be executed for each element. Higher order functions allow us to abstract actions. They can be in a variety of ways. For example, you can have functions that create new functions, functions that change other functions, you can even write functions that provide new types of control flows. How cool is that? Think simple to make it possible to solve high level problems.

## Day 27: April 10

**Today's Progress**: Start ES6(work in progress)


**Thoughts:** Today was a day full of allergic rhinitis.I had difficulty administering and completing the "Use Destruction Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects" item. Rhinitis does not like immediacy. Good to know. I hope tomorrow will be better, meanwhile, I keep trying to build simple examples.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 28: April 11

**Today's Progress**: ES6(work in progress)


**Thoughts:** Another day of rhinitis. I put examples in github, I started to develop a basic contact form with html, CSS and JS, I hope to finally finish tomorrow ES6.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)

## Day 29: April 12

**Today's Progress**: ES6(completed)


**Thoughts:** Missing @media query and organizing the code from my contact form. I put more examples in github. Tomorrow I start Regular Expressions with an almost childish joy.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 30: April 13

**Today's Progress**: Regular Expressions(In progress)


**Thoughts:** I exercised the basics of ES6 (I've sent more examples to github), I stopped in the "Match Anything with Wildcard Period" item of Regular Expressions and tomorrow I finally hope to finish my little project of contact form.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 31: April 14

**Today's Progress**: Regular Expressions(In progress)


**Thoughts:** Sunday is the day that I work the most and I run the risk of not coding. I made a contact portfolio and I'm playing with it, since I knew it would take me a while to say that it is ready, I decided to put it in the codepen. I stopped in the item "Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times" of regular expressions (which, by the way: it's fun, but no joke). When I'm coding, I'm happy.

**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 32: April 15

**Today's Progress**: Jokenpo(start)


**Thoughts:** Today was the day to test basic knowledge making the game "Jokenpô" (stone, paper and scissors). My first `Math.random()` in JavaScript!

**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://codepen.io/emevonlou/pen/jRaMmx)



## Day 33: April 16

**Today's Progress**: Regex(in progress)


**Thoughts:** Today was a day full of different obligations. I could not contain my curiosity about the production of CSS animations, and of course, as an absolutely curious being, I went to test. Until it worked. I studied Javascript and Regex, I made examples in github.


**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)




## Day 34: April 17

**Today's Progress**: Regex(in progress)


**Thoughts:** It was an exclusive day for Regex, I had enough initial difficulty in solving the challenges but something has saved me from sleepless nights: A Udemy (Free course, which for me is being a relief. I have discussed some examples of FreecodeCamp (Regex) in my gitHub.

**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 35: April 18

**Today's Progress**: Regex and Debugging(completed)


**Thoughts:** It was hard to finish the Regex, I needed more time and external resources(courses) to reach understanding. But in the excitement, I realized how Debugging section is fun and start Basic Data Structures tomorrow.


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/emevonlou)


## Day 36: April 19

**Today's Progress**: Javascript exercises


**Thoughts:** So today was another day filled with wonderful obligations. Among them, my study in JavaScript!For lack of time today, before entering the session Basic Data Structures, I decided to exercise JS. I learned more, in a meticulous way, how are operations with destructuring, solved exercises and put examples in my GitHub. I had no difficulty understanding, things seem much clearer to me today, and I can say that I am taking advantage of the opportunity in the exercise of this learning, the destructuring in almost everything.


**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 37: April 20

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Data Structures


**Thoughts:** Another day in Javascript exercise! I'm treating this phase with very maturely. I continue in my Udemy courses, sending examples to GitHub, I stopped today in the "Create complex multi-dimensional arrays" of the session "Basic Data Structures". I was waiting for this moment, my desire to move fast has been shorter than my desire to live every detail. I hope during this race week I do not get excited to finish soon.

## Day 38: April 21

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Data Structures(in progress)


**Thoughts:** I stopped in the "Use the Delete Keyword to Remove Object Properties" item(freecodecamp), I solved exercises and sent examples to my GitHub. I have not had very serious problems so far, although the arrays have caused me a habitual impatience.Of course I've been wrong many times, I was in a hurry to put the answers right away and with array things can not be like this. Not for a beginner.

## Day 40: April 23

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts:**  Today was the day to convert celsius to fahrenheit in the freeCodeCamp. I chose in this section, make it a challenge per day and will try to create something with html and css too (hope that be a good idea-`laughs`). Put some examples in github with the "for" and "for / in". It was fun.

## Day 41: April 24

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  I finished two items from the session "Basic Algorithm Scripting", Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, and Reverse a String. I put an example of my solutions in gitHub and codepen with html and basic css (codepen did not like my internal 'onkeyup' in html- YAY -I have little bugs to solve!). Happiness is a hot weapon with html, css and JS.

## Day 43: April 26

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  Continuing with the Javascript studies, I did one more example of `this` with the `bind function` and two others about `arrow function`, I finished one more item of the freecodecamp(Factorialize the Number) and I'm already thinking about what to do with it tomorrow, of course, including html and css. I put the examples in github. I'm exhausted. But giving up is not an option!

## Day 44: April 27

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  Today was the day to face only the challenges in freeCodeCamp. I did not focused on anything else, I really wanted to finish what had me exhausted for the lack of time the day before. With patience, step by step, using me of what I had already studied, I moved on, without haste...and it worked! I hope to finally finish the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" section tomorrow. I feel proud to have found in humility once more a way to overcome my limits.

## Day 48: May 01

**Today's Progress**: Functional Programming(Completed)

**Thoughts:**  I spent all the day alternating between my daily tasks and the Freecodecamp). It was difficult, but absolutely rewarding. And it is with great joy that I say that tomorrow I begin Intermediate Algorithm Scripting !!(I put an example with a little about arrays in gitHub).

## Day 49: May 02

**Today's Progress**: Training JS

**Thoughts:**  Yesterday was a day that demanded too much from me, so today was the day I spent my son Joaquim essentially. But of course I could not fail to comply with my commitment made here (and much respected by me). So I joked a little with arrays and put examples in github.

## Day 50: May 03

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(Start)

**Thoughts:**  One of the best things in life is you recognize and respect your own time. Incredibly, the good old paradoxical relationship comes back to me when it comes to algorithms. The will to go fast and at the same time a deep need to transmute everything slowly. Well, I was like that today, I stopped in the "Wherefore art thou" item, giving me the gift of an expectation and the peculiar freedom that only the 100 days of code managed to attribute to me. I put a very basic example of forEach in GitHub, and I end with a sentence that could only be said in Portuguese: Que eu adore o basicão, pois!

## Day 51: May 04

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(in progress)/ transforming my HTMl into semantic!/ and training JS

**Thoughts:**  Today I spent a bit investing in my portfolio, using the beautiful html semantics! I really followed the rules and when I realized it was there, those wonderful, long-awaited curves. I am very happy about the return of what I have studied. Of course, I still have to learn an infinite amount of things, but to know that things are working, if organized so, without appearing to be something of an absurd sacrifice (as it seemed before I considered myself a real beginner) is absolutely gratifying and encouraging. Making it simple works !!!!! I made one more item in the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting session (Wherefore art thou) and put another simple and wonderful example of implementing my own foreach (OMG <3)

## Day 52: May 05

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  I stopped in the `Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers` item, exactly in the middle of the road! For me? Extraordinary. I never thought of going that far, and I feel more and more distant from what made me doubt it. I put an example map (map an array to another array with the same size only with the transformed data) in GitHub. Tomorrow has more! YAY!

## Day 53: May 06

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  Conclude four more items from the "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" session, I put two more map examples in github. I deliberately studied also html semantic and animations with css, all very pure.I hope tomorrow finally to leave for the next session of the freecodecamp with the same joy and with more time!

## Day 54: May 07

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(completed)

**Thoughts:**  I was able to finish Intermediate Algorithm Scripting! I followed only the step by step, trying to think what I could do with what I had learned with JS / ES6 in each one, and things just went right. Sometimes I took tips, but I always tried to follow my own line of reasoning. I can not say that it was easy, and in a way I'm glad I could not say (by the degree of difficulty that reigned throughout the process and even then, that did not stop me.) I put filter and reduce examples in GitHub, I trained keyframes and animations to celebrate.

## Day 55: May 08

**Today's Progress**: Training JS

**Thoughts:** Another day of training of JS of its own free will (I realized that after a crazy frequency of challenges, this is essential for me and it works), is how to retreat a little, for the jump to be higher. I realized on this journey that each of us has a rhythm, and there dwells a truth that deserves respect. I particularly believe in the beauty of each one's rhythm and I also believe that this is how the extraordinary teams are formed! I put more examples in GitHub! I go on, there is no back (YAY)!

## Day 56: May 09

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects(Start)

**Thoughts:** I started JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects facing Palindrome Checker! It was constructive, I had difficulties (the dynamism of the JS gives me lots of laughs - I made a lot of mistakes), but in the end, everything went well. I have advanced and the way I have dealt with the new challenges has proved this to me. Happy.

## Day 57: May 10

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects(Start)

**Thoughts:** Today was the day of the famous Roman Numeral Converter (Aha!) I just realized how much I had written after I finished (And I thought I only felt this with html, CSS- if I'm feeling the same thing whit JS is a good sign! ), If, else, push and everything else that I have right! I'm already thinking about what to do with this challenge and  html and CSS  together (every day I do something simple with HTML-CSS and give to my son Joaquim <3). I still have time. I put examples in GitHub about the difference between an imperative and declarative JS code. Tomorrow has more challenge!

## Day 58: May 11

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects(in progress)

**Thoughts:** Caesars Cipher completed! This session has been the most fun for me. In addition to helping to reaffirm what I learned and I'm learning the way I like (simple) by establishing an incredible union between all the challenges that I have experienced in FreeCodeCamp, it makes me think in a more comprehensive way, reaffirming not only the code itself, but other things that are very important to me. I put examples in GitHub with the new methods learned for strings, `Arrayfrom`, `Arrayof`, `Arrayfind` and `Arrayfilter`. I also put in my codepen finally my Palindrome checker (in html, css and JS)!

## Day 59: May 12

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects(in progress)

**Thoughts:** Another challenge completed, today was the Telephone Number Validator day with its crazy and organized regex. I had never done anything like that before, when I finished that 'endless' list of commands, I was in doubt if it was going to work (I love my beginner things), but it did work on the first try! I put more examples in GitHub and tomorrow there's more (YaY)!

## Day 60: May 13

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects(completed)

**Thoughts:** This session had to end with the Cash Register! When I finished my last challenge before the long dreamed-up certificate, I thought of all the things I had to deprive myself with joy, and that now I could finally turn to them, with the same joy, to inform that it was worth it. I did not imagine it would be today, I could only believe when, when the final one arrived, I thought of all the things I love and that they understood me in order to give me a push, a map, a filter, a reduce, a find in the console .log (life). Deep gratitude to the community, for making me understand for the beyond of the code. I'm in a hurry, I want to be up to it, every day, trying the simple and transmuting with it, all the complexity. Very happy.

## Day 61: May 14

**Today's Progress**: Front End Libraries Certification(Start)

**Thoughts:** Today was my first contact with Bootstrap, I stopped in the item "Ditch Custom CSS for Bootstrap". After a long, gentle journey through HTML, CSS and JS, I feel at home to say with vehemence that they together are a threesome that delights. To come across a framework that makes things more practical and understand the step by step, it was a beautiful way of saying to me that I learned. And I did it with joy. Starting dancing with bootstrap is an incredible experience. I put more examples of JS in GitHub. Thank you so much the community for the support, you are amazing.

## Day 62: May 15

**Today's Progress**: Front End Libraries Certification(in progress)

**Thoughts:** Second day with Bootstrap, I confess I'm having a lot of fun. By learning about those wonderful strategic "classes", the first thing I did was to go testing on my old projects and see everything working was rewarding. I value my first projects too much, each of them carries a story, a moment of my life that I will carry forever. So, today I concludes another item from the session Front End Libraries Certification (Bootstrap), practiced JS with 'multiple promises' and 'prototypal inheritance' (I've put examples in github) and so far I'm training Bootstrap (grid system, media object, borders, colors and text ), perhaps the night is long, alternating my gaze between my son Joaquim and the this cold screen, hotter than ever, with code.

## Day 63: May 16

**Today's Progress**: Front End Libraries Certification(in progress)

**Thoughts:** So let's go for the third day with Bootstrap! I'm using my old tribute page to test the basic features. I almost get lost in time, putting in, replacing classes, imagining, testing things different from the standard, and returning to the pattern (independent of order) to recognize the best path. I realized that the best thing at this stage is to test, you learn a lot from that. I've put in the item "Add Font Awesome Icons to our Buttons" (I'm trying my best to take it easy - this has been important for my learning), I've put examples in JS GitHub (class extended, Symbols, Iterators and Iterables). And honestly, tomorrow has more!

## Day 64: May 17

**Today's Progress**: Front End Libraries Certification(in progress)

**Thoughts:** Today was another day full of different obligations. But I confess, it was easier to administer, and every day, it's getting easier. As if I were working out an algorithm for each task to be done. Before entering this journey I had no idea of the level of depth that is attained by risking being a web developer. Subtly, things are changing for you. So, one fine day, you will enjoy more and more of what you even imagined would exist or would be possible in your life. This holds true for both code and everyday life. So, I stopped the "Style Text Inputs as Form Controls" (Bootstrap-FreeCodeCamp), put JS examples in GitHub(Generators and proxy), and took a screenshot of my tribute page before (without Bootstrap) and then (with Bootstrap). Now, I need to go play with Joaquim and tell him, once again, about my fantastic experience.

## Day 65: May 18

**Today's Progress**: Bootstrap(Completed)

**Thoughts:** Still in adaptation period with Bootstrap (makes things more practical and maybe so I have considered a priori strange). I was not dealing with any abstraction, things were ready and I just really needed to know their place in the code. But that's where it is, this opened up another possibility: to imagine, visualize and feel capable of, in less time to realize. In a way I gained more time, but I also noticed another important thing: I was so always busy learning, that I needed time again, that beginner time, to feel, and that was when one of the lessons of Bootstrap became clear to me to the beyond the code. I am building my personal website and also put examples in github(Async/Await). Very happy to know that tomorrow jQuery start!

## Day 66: May 19

**Today's Progress**:Training Bootstrap, JS and working on my site.

**Thoughts:** Training day and consolidation. As in every interval between one session and another, I will start jQuery after my revisions. I reviewed Bootstrap, put JS examples in GitHub (Async / Await with multiple promises and
String.prototype.padStart and padEnd). I've implemented more classes in the tags of my personal site (Not being done with Bootstrap because 'pure' knowledge is part of my story and I want to keep it- in the case.) I am very eager to create things, but I do not have time to this, which causes me some dismay, I hope that tomorrow I will take some more time to accomplish the feats I have dreamed of. The day was tiring, but I was able to do what was in the plans.

## Day 67: May 20

**Today's Progress**:Training Bootstrap, JS and working on my site.

**Thoughts:**My funny system: A speed of execution of FreecodeCamp and a slowness in the choice of images in my code. How good to recognize in this way! Something happened that was not in my plans (that's reason to celebrate). I got too excited about building my site and training JS. Of course I'm anxious to start jQuery, but I have some extraordinarily things to do which I can not leave out of the way. In css, absolutely delighted by the unit (.em), in html very excited in tables with Bootstrap, in JS very happy with the utility of Object entries / Object.values(I put examples in GitHub)! Taking advantage to "rigueur". Happy!

## Day 68: May 21

**Today's Progress**: Start jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I had very little time hj but I managed to do a bit of everything to start jquery (= D)! I stopped the item
"Change Text Inside an Element Using jQuery". Dynamic, practical and easy to understand (That was my first impression). I studied algorithms (I put examples in GitHub) and worked a little more on my personal website.

## Day 69: May 22

**Today's Progress**: jQuery(in progress)

**Thoughts:** I stopped in the "Target the Parent of an Element Using jQuery" item, started my studies with sass, installed, tested and imported some files (YAY). I've trained algorithms (js- I've put an example in github) and have gone a little farther in developing my personal site. And it is with all joy that I say: tomorrow there is more!

## Day 70: May 23

**Today's Progress**: jQuery(Completed)

**Thoughts:** jQuery is wonderful, I loved this freecodecamp preview! But of course I'm doing apart, my alternative exercises. Today was also a day of playing with SASS within my portfolio page, importing more pages, adding more variables and finding out today that I can nest my selectors! I put more examples of algorithms in GitHub and tomorrow I started in freecodecamp what I had already started since half of the challenges of jquery: the amazing pink hulk called sass.

## Day 71: May 24

**Today's Progress**: Sass(start)

**Thoughts:** Today was the day to learn more of Sass's properties, variables / @ if / @ else if / @ else / @ for starting the verisimilitude with Javascript. Difficulties still encounter, as in every great beginning, in putting each thing in its specific place. Today was easier because I started studying sass while still following the jQuery challenges (But I believe things will heat up by the end- laughs). If I had known before that I should have a preview for the beyond of the superficial of each subject, I would have had less difficulty. Modifying the strategy was a gift I gave myself. I stopped in the "Use @each to Map Over Items in a List" section of the Sass session, I trained algorithms in JS (I put an example in GitHub) and I worked a little more on my seemingly shelved projects!

## Day 72: May 25

**Today's Progress**: Sass(in progress)

**Thoughts:** Today was a day full of different activities, wow I'm so tired. But even that did not stop me from having the pleasure of another day of code. I trained javascript by manipulating arrays, stopped in the "Apply a Style Until a Condition is Met with @while" section of the freecodecamp 'Sass' session and made improvements to my eternal production of tests on my portfolio page. Everything worked!

## Day 73: May 26

**Today's Progress**: Sass(completed)

**Thoughts:** Sass passed so fast! My happiness is knowing that I will still have it for a long time and my life, I am testing everything in my personal portfolio and it has worked. Today was also day of training algorithms in JS (I put an example in GitHub). Very happy to know that I am ever closer to the possibility so dreamed of me. My next session is React (YAY)!

## Day 74: May 27

**Today's Progress**: React(start)

**Thoughts:**  Starting a disinterested loyalty with React is very encouraging. I Concluded some items from the Udemy course and stopped at "Render HTML Elements to the DOM" of the freecodecamp React session. And of course I keep training Javascript, I put another example in my GitHub to persist the rhythm! tomorrow has more!!

## Day 75: May 28

**Today's Progress**: React(In progress)

**Thoughts:**  So I'm in progress. Going easy on React (I'm trying, I promise), even because I want to synchronize it with my udemy course. I literally love the beginning difficulties, I also like when they are demystifying, the curiosity they provoke, the momentary indignation with their genius sentence at making us laugh at ourselves! I stopped in the "Define an HTML Class in JSX" item, I repeated the previous challenge a few times, reaffirming the knowledge. I put an example in GitHub of Algorithms in JS, I trained Sass, and I watched some more React classes from Udemy's course! Forward <3


## Day 76: May 29

**Today's Progress**: React(In progress)

**Thoughts:**  The day was full, so full that I almost could not stand face to face with the binary lawyer of my fate (computer). Glad I got it! I stopped in the "Create a React Component" section of the React session, I trained algorithms, I put a second chunk solution from yesterday in github. I hope tomorrow, that my time is proportional to my will.

## Day 77: May 30

**Today's Progress**: React(In progress)

**Thoughts:**  I stopped the "Write a React Component from Scratch" Item, I trained Javascript algorithms (of course I have a new GitHub example), I trained sass (variables, import) on my personal site. The only thing that has bothered me is that because I'm not skipping anything in Udemy's course, I have had difficulty synchronizing it with the freecodecamp. Even so, I move on, today I got more excited about React, this idea to create and compose components is great! Just like yesterday and today, the next few days will be filled with external tasks for me, I will change my residence, and I have a lot to organize, but I am still in the 100 days of code, so I will certainly do whatever it takes to make myself present.
