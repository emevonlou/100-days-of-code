# 100 Days Of Code - 2019 - Log

### Day 1: March 15

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 items and started the Introduction to Basic CSS, concluding the first five items.

**Thoughts:** I had an initial difficulty with nesting and in the first few lines I insisted on putting semicolon at the end of everything. The methodology and respectful rhythm of the freecodecamp helped me a lot to stay focused so that I was naturally adapting myself. The terms used although grammatically similar to everyday, seem to dance with the tags, this made everything as interesting as dangerous and delayed me a little ... That is, a paradox: The best thing in a challenge!

## Day 2: March 16

**Today's Progress**: Complete the Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** I was a few minutes late because I hesitated in understanding the Fallback value to a CSS Variable. When I knew what to do, I did not know exactly where to put it. I confess that it made me laugh at myself sometimes. The second day was much warmer! CSS is addictive.

## Day 3: March 17

**Today's Progress**: Started Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts:** My purpose was to finish "Applied Visual Design". But today, I had to be more present in my son's life. I'm leaving nine extra items for tomorrow, with great joy for that.

## Day 4: March 18

**Today's Progress**: Applied Visual Design and Applied Accessibility completed!

**Thoughts:** I'm on the fourth day and I'm still surprised. The dialectical relationship between my person and knowledge is being given to me, could not be better. For each step, a "welcome" and a "goodbye" to the doubts that before the learning process, it seemed to me an endless condition. I was surprised by the Bezier curve, in how it makes the movement more harmonious.I had fun grouping elements with fieldset and improving accessibility with Landmark.I was happy , because there is nothing better than appreciate the main content with your element . =) I felt safe when I learned that I can improve content using the article element. I was feel great recognizing and identifying the figcaption element nested to the figure element to construct the independence of specific content, related to the main content. I found difficulties, but I did not lose focus. Let's move on! I look forward to the next topic.

## Day 5: March 19

**Today's Progress**: Responsive Web Design Principles completed.

**Thoughts:** I had difficulty with Responsive Web Design Principles. It took me to finish the last two items. What helped me to make it simple were the previous concepts, in particular, of the basic properties of css. How basic is important!

## Day 6: March 20

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** I believe that with Flexbox you can create and organize layouts with CSS3 in a very elegant way. Through its properties / possibilities, I realized that tasks can be achieved with very few lines of code.

## Day 7: March 21

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grid completed.

**Thoughts:** We can more easily determine the reading stream.
The grid helps us design the harmonious ones by balancing the weights of the graphic elements of the layout.
Help position the elements more accurately.

## Day 8: March 22

**Today's Progress**: "Build a Tribute Page" completed.

**Thoughts:** Today was deliberately challenging. I considered the rules, though I felt like breaking a few. I may have broken it from trying so hard to follow them. One of the things that most appeals to me in the world code is precisely this incredible possibility of freedom. Anyway, very happy. I've encountered difficulties, of course. I'm a good beginner.

## Day 9: March 23

**Today's Progress**: "Tribute Page" github repository.

**Thoughts:** Today I decided to reinforce the knowledge by creating a github repository with the content of the previous challenge.
It is using [express to serve the static files](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/starter/static-files.html).

## Day 10: March 24

**Today's Progress**: Building a Survey Form.(work in progress)

**Thoughts:** After a race at a pace incomprehensible to me of assimilation of isolated knowledge, I saw myself in another level: to organize everything.Being cautious has helped me focus on the details, I'm taking it easy, and a hurry just to make everything simpler. But today, better than yesterday, I felt progress in relation to to the pace I need.

## Day 11: March 25

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form completed.

**Thoughts:** My experience today was sensational, especially when my submit button disappeared. I thought: OMG. The web development's discipline is causing me a tremendous good mood. After a few frustrating attempts, a "noob" feeling became more and more present, then I decided to impose myself with a peculiar simplicity.

## Day 12: March 26

**Today's Progress**: "Survey Form" github repository/ Starting build of Product Landing Page.

**Thoughts:** I like the initiations of projects, they always raise the possibility of the permanence of something beautiful. Of course, for this to happen, we need to devote time. I followed steps similar to the previous one: I used node.js and express as static file server, prepared the html structure and I am observing it as the one that decides, in all beginner joy, how the structures will "dance".

## Day 13: March 27

**Today's Progress**: Build of Product Landing Page.(work in progress)

**Thoughts:** Today was full of different obligations, but amazingly for me, I made some progress in css.

## Day 14: March 28

**Today's Progress**: Build of Product Landing Page.(work in progress)

**Thoughts:** Acquiring knowledge is something valuable. But holding on to organizing them is sublime, requiring depth. It's like a second affirmation of your goal. I confess, this part has been the hardest part of me. In programming itself, in what I felt in deep freedom, I committed to the value of the code, in the discipline, so that my code never looked like what it should be, although it works. This is so funny, because I felt so good programming messy loops. It's like feeling you know how to drive well and be disapproved in the traffic test for not knowing the proper procedure in practice. I feel that the initiative of the 100 days of the code is taking me where I always wanted to be, but I did not know where to start. Today was to put my "landing page" that was not at all responsive and not pretty, in github- with the promise of daily implementation until it is good for me, and organizational study day on Grid and Flexbox. Going back is not an option. That's when I can say gently: Forward.

## Day 15: March 29

**Today's Progress**: Landing Page Completed


**Thoughts:** The curious case for me in today's progress has been to keep each other within the boundaries with the code. You wait for the answer to continue, as in a dance, so maybe my menu has not been responsive (laughs). But I realized with the feat, so simple, so true. Tomorrow I try again and again .... Today was the day to investigate, to order and to transform. Happy.

## Day 16: March 30

**Today's Progress**: Training grid and Flexbox.


**Thoughts:** Today was a day of break between projects, I decided to extend the "Saturday night fever" taking advantage of all the charm that Grid and Flexbox promote me. Why do I like it so much? Because it is necessary to be lived like this. And these things are invaluable. I researched, messed, solved and customized examples. I mixed it as someone does at a party, enchanted by the scent of flowers. It's working!

## Day 17: March 31

**Today's Progress**: Start Build a Technical Documentation Page.


**Thoughts:** I started the technical documentation page today, preparing the structure of HTML and CSS, and gradually, responsiveness is no longer a problem. One of the things that has most impressed me in this learning is that it always puts me in a position of humility, but that, in disinterested fidelity, makes me look up.


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://codepen.io/emevonlou/pen/XQWEPj)


## Day 18: April 1

**Today's Progress**: Start Build a Technical Documentation Page.(work in progress)


**Thoughts:** Even with the day full of things to do, even believing that in many moments I could not get the time, I managed to realize a little of what stayed in my memories all day. Happy.


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://codepen.io/emevonlou/pen/XQWEPj)


## Day 19: April 2

**Today's Progress**: Technical Documentation Page Completed.


**Thoughts:** I tried to produce something simple with a subtle touch of ~80's shell visuals, I wanted to make "hover {}" in the "links" and "headers" and a light simulation of "Monochrome Display type CRT". I wanted documentation that provoked me (with css and html) a certain curiosity without losing its simplicity. Historical knowledge is a revive, and performing that work with html, css and reading more about the shell certainly was a sure assertion of this.


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://codepen.io/emevonlou/pen/XQWEPj)


## Day 20: April 3

**Today's Progress**: Start Personal Portfolio Webpage.


**Thoughts:** I prepared the html skeleton, this time with a bit more attention than before. I wrote the css and putting @media (which I consider particularly wonderful). I've been exploring the repetitions, and I've been able to develop a form that always enables responsiveness(finally). I've had some difficulties, for example, my portfolio h2 "refusing" to be centralized, but I can confess that I'm anxious so I can accomplish the deeds of my simplest ideas. I believe that with time, dedication, and respect for each experience, I'll understand each thing, in its truest sense. I hope I can finish tomorrow!


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)


## Day 21: April 4

**Today's Progress**: Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.(completed)


**Thoughts:** Today was the day I finished my portfolio. The problem of the "h2" tag was solved, I, for a mishap of existence, had typed the wrong session id. I continued with the development, today had more spacing between the elements of the nav than I did on my landing page - I really wanted something different from the ones I had done and also the one indicated. Tomorrow I start the Javascript course (YAY), and so begins my process again.I am immensely grateful to the community, all of you, for your support, encouragement, understanding. Without you, this process would not have been lived with such tenderness. Gratitude for the various lessons. It was necessary to be lived, and you, along with me, believed. Thanks!

## Day 22: April 5

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Javascript


**Thoughts:** Today was the day to start the JavaScript language, one of the main characters from 1995 to the present. I gave myself the pleasure, from the comments, to the Quoting Strings with Single Quotes. Searching on each topic using in a "peering" style, exploring theoretical concepts of the js language. Just as I have discovered css (addictive) and html (stimulant), I want to complete the basic javascript with the same category it represents for me. happy!

## Day 23: April 6

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Javascript- I stopped in Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function.


**Thoughts:** I continued the study in the code sentences, I had fun with push, pop, shift, unshift in arrays. Trying to think as simply as possible, this has helped me a lot in learning. Finding out how Javascript is organized is a wonderful task. Understanding the indefinite value returned from a function reminded me of the unpredictability we have developed, simply because we do not include return statements, and even though there is a correct internal process, the returned value will always be undefined. My happiness to know, that even this, javaScript teaches.

## Day 24: April 7

**Today's Progress**: Basic Javascript-Completed


**Thoughts:** I can never forget that Sunday day. The challenge of a new language is never an easy task. I began by deconstructing within myself this idea of difficulty. It was not easy either. But I felt more stubborn than scared. This recognition was very important, because it was what in the moments threatening, made me stop and think. Everything became clearer later. Javascript reminded me of C ++ on several occasions and the smile was always inevitable, that was also encouraging. I accepted this challenge as a tacit contract. Tomorrow I'll start ES6! I do not know where to put so much happiness.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/emevonlou)


## Day 25: April 8

**Today's Progress**: Start ES6


**Thoughts:** After an exciting weekend with Javascript, I had to start very calmly on ES6. `var` gave way to `let` and `const` is the favorite. With `Object.freeze` I learned to value specific objects, to replace them and to display them when necessary. I was not accustomed to writing constants in "capslock", this gave me some instant bugs accompanied by shy smiles later. On the `Arrow Functions`- (OMG), there is a simplicity full of meaning, less lines of code, that say more than enough to impressed.

## Day 26: April 9

**Today's Progress**: Start ES6(work in progress)


**Thoughts:** I am exercising and learning to perceive when a concept asks to be abstracted into a new word. And something has taken my thinking for a few hours: Arrays for example, when an array is provided for the method to act on it, forEach expects only one required argument: the function to be executed for each element. Higher order functions allow us to abstract actions. They can be in a variety of ways. For example, you can have functions that create new functions, functions that change other functions, you can even write functions that provide new types of control flows. How cool is that? Think simple to make it possible to solve high level problems.

## Day 27: April 10

**Today's Progress**: Start ES6(work in progress)


**Thoughts:** Today was a day full of allergic rhinitis.I had difficulty administering and completing the "Use Destruction Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects" item. Rhinitis does not like immediacy. Good to know. I hope tomorrow will be better, meanwhile, I keep trying to build simple examples.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 28: April 11

**Today's Progress**: ES6(work in progress)


**Thoughts:** Another day of rhinitis. I put examples in github, I started to develop a basic contact form with html, CSS and JS, I hope to finally finish tomorrow ES6.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)

## Day 29: April 12

**Today's Progress**: ES6(completed)


**Thoughts:** Missing @media query and organizing the code from my contact form. I put more examples in github. Tomorrow I start Regular Expressions with an almost childish joy.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 30: April 13

**Today's Progress**: Regular Expressions(In progress)


**Thoughts:** I exercised the basics of ES6 (I've sent more examples to github), I stopped in the "Match Anything with Wildcard Period" item of Regular Expressions and tomorrow I finally hope to finish my little project of contact form.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 31: April 14

**Today's Progress**: Regular Expressions(In progress)


**Thoughts:** Sunday is the day that I work the most and I run the risk of not coding. I made a contact portfolio and I'm playing with it, since I knew it would take me a while to say that it is ready, I decided to put it in the codepen. I stopped in the item "Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times" of regular expressions (which, by the way: it's fun, but no joke). When I'm coding, I'm happy.

**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 32: April 15

**Today's Progress**: Jokenpo(start)


**Thoughts:** Today was the day to test basic knowledge making the game "Jokenpô" (stone, paper and scissors). My first `Math.random()` in JavaScript!

**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://codepen.io/emevonlou/pen/jRaMmx)



## Day 33: April 16

**Today's Progress**: Regex(in progress)


**Thoughts:** Today was a day full of different obligations. I could not contain my curiosity about the production of CSS animations, and of course, as an absolutely curious being, I went to test. Until it worked. I studied Javascript and Regex, I made examples in github.


**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)




## Day 34: April 17

**Today's Progress**: Regex(in progress)


**Thoughts:** It was an exclusive day for Regex, I had enough initial difficulty in solving the challenges but something has saved me from sleepless nights: A Udemy (Free course, which for me is being a relief. I have discussed some examples of FreecodeCamp (Regex) in my gitHub.

**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 35: April 18

**Today's Progress**: Regex and Debugging(completed)


**Thoughts:** It was hard to finish the Regex, I needed more time and external resources(courses) to reach understanding. But in the excitement, I realized how Debugging section is fun and start Basic Data Structures tomorrow.


**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCampProgress!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/emevonlou)


## Day 36: April 19

**Today's Progress**: Javascript exercises


**Thoughts:** So today was another day filled with wonderful obligations. Among them, my study in JavaScript!For lack of time today, before entering the session Basic Data Structures, I decided to exercise JS. I learned more, in a meticulous way, how are operations with destructuring, solved exercises and put examples in my GitHub. I had no difficulty understanding, things seem much clearer to me today, and I can say that I am taking advantage of the opportunity in the exercise of this learning, the destructuring in almost everything.


**Link to work:** [MyProgress!](https://github.com/emevonlou/learning_js/tree/master/src)


## Day 37: April 20

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Data Structures


**Thoughts:** Another day in Javascript exercise! I'm treating this phase with very maturely. I continue in my Udemy courses, sending examples to GitHub, I stopped today in the "Create complex multi-dimensional arrays" of the session "Basic Data Structures". I was waiting for this moment, my desire to move fast has been shorter than my desire to live every detail. I hope during this race week I do not get excited to finish soon.

## Day 38: April 21

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Data Structures(in progress)


**Thoughts:** I stopped in the "Use the Delete Keyword to Remove Object Properties" item(freecodecamp), I solved exercises and sent examples to my GitHub. I have not had very serious problems so far, although the arrays have caused me a habitual impatience.Of course I've been wrong many times, I was in a hurry to put the answers right away and with array things can not be like this. Not for a beginner.

## Day 40: April 23

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts:**  Today was the day to convert celsius to fahrenheit in the freeCodeCamp. I chose in this section, make it a challenge per day and will try to create something with html and css too (hope that be a good idea-`laughs`). Put some examples in github with the "for" and "for / in". It was fun.

## Day 41: April 24

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  I finished two items from the session "Basic Algorithm Scripting", Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, and Reverse a String. I put an example of my solutions in gitHub and codepen with html and basic css (codepen did not like my internal 'onkeyup' in html- YAY -I have little bugs to solve!). Happiness is a hot weapon with html, css and JS.

## Day 43: April 26

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  Continuing with the Javascript studies, I did one more example of `this` with the `bind function` and two others about `arrow function`, I finished one more item of the freecodecamp(Factorialize the Number) and I'm already thinking about what to do with it tomorrow, of course, including html and css. I put the examples in github. I'm exhausted. But giving up is not an option!

## Day 44: April 27

**Today's Progress**: Start Basic Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  Today was the day to face only the challenges in freeCodeCamp. I did not focused on anything else, I really wanted to finish what had me exhausted for the lack of time the day before. With patience, step by step, using me of what I had already studied, I moved on, without haste...and it worked! I hope to finally finish the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" section tomorrow. I feel proud to have found in humility once more a way to overcome my limits.

## Day 48: May 01

**Today's Progress**: Functional Programming(Completed)

**Thoughts:**  I spent all the day alternating between my daily tasks and the Freecodecamp). It was difficult, but absolutely rewarding. And it is with great joy that I say that tomorrow I begin Intermediate Algorithm Scripting !!(I put an example with a little about arrays in gitHub).

## Day 49: May 02

**Today's Progress**: Training JS

**Thoughts:**  Yesterday was a day that demanded too much from me, so today was the day I spent my son Joaquim essentially. But of course I could not fail to comply with my commitment made here (and much respected by me). So I joked a little with arrays and put examples in github.

## Day 50: May 03

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(Start)

**Thoughts:**  One of the best things in life is you recognize and respect your own time. Incredibly, the good old paradoxical relationship comes back to me when it comes to algorithms. The will to go fast and at the same time a deep need to transmute everything slowly. Well, I was like that today, I stopped in the "Wherefore art thou" item, giving me the gift of an expectation and the peculiar freedom that only the 100 days of code managed to attribute to me. I put a very basic example of forEach in GitHub, and I end with a sentence that could only be said in Portuguese: Que eu adore o basicão, pois!

## Day 51: May 04

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(in progress)/ transforming my HTMl into semantic!/ and training JS

**Thoughts:**  Today I spent a bit investing in my portfolio, using the beautiful html semantics! I really followed the rules and when I realized it was there, those wonderful, long-awaited curves. I am very happy about the return of what I have studied. Of course, I still have to learn an infinite amount of things, but to know that things are working, if organized so, without appearing to be something of an absurd sacrifice (as it seemed before I considered myself a real beginner) is absolutely gratifying and encouraging. Making it simple works !!!!! I made one more item in the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting session (Wherefore art thou) and put another simple and wonderful example of implementing my own foreach (OMG <3)

## Day 52: May 05

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  I stopped in the `Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers` item, exactly in the middle of the road! For me? Extraordinary. I never thought of going that far, and I feel more and more distant from what made me doubt it. I put an example map (map an array to another array with the same size only with the transformed data) in GitHub. Tomorrow has more! YAY!

## Day 53: May 06

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(in progress)

**Thoughts:**  Conclude four more items from the "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" session, I put two more map examples in github. I deliberately studied also html semantic and animations with css, all very pure.I hope tomorrow finally to leave for the next session of the freecodecamp with the same joy and with more time!

## Day 54: May 07

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting(completed)

**Thoughts:**  I was able to finish Intermediate Algorithm Scripting! I followed only the step by step, trying to think what I could do with what I had learned with JS / ES6 in each one, and things just went right. Sometimes I took tips, but I always tried to follow my own line of reasoning. I can not say that it was easy, and in a way I'm glad I could not say (by the degree of difficulty that reigned throughout the process and even then, that did not stop me.) I put filter and reduce examples in GitHub, I trained keyframes and animations to celebrate.

## Day 55: May 08

**Today's Progress**: Training JS

**Thoughts:** Another day of training of JS of its own free will (I realized that after a crazy frequency of challenges, this is essential for me and it works), is how to retreat a little, for the jump to be higher. I realized on this journey that each of us has a rhythm, and there dwells a truth that deserves respect. I particularly believe in the beauty of each one's rhythm and I also believe that this is how the extraordinary teams are formed! I put more examples in GitHub! I go on, there is no back (YAY)!

## Day 56: May 09

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects(Start)

**Thoughts:** I started JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects facing Palindrome Checker! It was constructive, I had difficulties (the dynamism of the JS gives me lots of laughs - I made a lot of mistakes), but in the end, everything went well. I have advanced and the way I have dealt with the new challenges has proved this to me. Happy.

## Day 57: May 10

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects(Start)

**Thoughts:** Today was the day of the famous Roman Numeral Converter (Aha!) I just realized how much I had written after I finished (And I thought I only felt this with html, CSS- if I'm feeling the same thing whit JS is a good sign! ), If, else, push and everything else that I have right! I'm already thinking about what to do with this challenge and  html and CSS  together (every day I do something simple with HTML-CSS and give to my son Joaquim <3). I still have time. I put examples in GitHub about the difference between an imperative and declarative JS code. Tomorrow has more challenge!

## Day 58: May 11

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects(in progress)

**Thoughts:** Caesars Cipher completed! This session has been the most fun for me. In addition to helping to reaffirm what I learned and I'm learning the way I like (simple) by establishing an incredible union between all the challenges that I have experienced in FreeCodeCamp, it makes me think in a more comprehensive way, reaffirming not only the code itself, but other things that are very important to me. I put examples in GitHub with the new methods learned for strings, `Arrayfrom`, `Arrayof`, `Arrayfind` and `Arrayfilter`. I also put in my codepen finally my Palindrome checker (in html, css and JS)!
